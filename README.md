# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
I decided to use a whie loop to iterate over the array. I would like to create another array to store the reverse information into. I then want to append i to the new array while subtracting 1 from i everytime the loop starts to then go the length of the origional array. Then print the new array with all the reverse information.
