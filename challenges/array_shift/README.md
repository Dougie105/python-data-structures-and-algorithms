<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge Description
Write a function called insert_shift_array which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency
Take in a list and a value
Find the center of the list and store that as the value 'middle'
If the length of the list is even then add the value to the middle of that list
If the length of the list is odd then add the value to the right of center
Insert/splice value at the index of 'middle'
Return value
